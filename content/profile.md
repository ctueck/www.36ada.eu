After managing a European public-interest, non-profit organisation for 15 years, I decided to embark on new professional adventures to work more independently and on a wider range of education-related topics. Since May 2023, I have worked as a consultant with different European projects and initiatives related to quality assurance, recognition, digitalisation and interoperability.

Previously I served as the Director of the European Quality Assurance Register for Higher Education ([EQAR](https://www.eqar.eu/)). After coordinating the founding of EQAR as Project Manager on behalf of its founding members (ENQA, ESU, EUA and EURASHE) from July 2007, I served as its first Director until April 2023. In that capacity, I led the conception, implementation and management of the Database of External Quality Assurance Results ([DEQAR](https://www.deqar.eu/)).

In my work I contributed closely to shaping the European Higher Education Area's ([EHEA](https://www.ehea.info/)) quality assurance framework, for example as a member of the Steering Group for the 2015 revision of the Standards and Guidelines for Quality Assurance in the European Higher Education Area ([ESG](https://www.eqar.eu/kb/esg/)), as a co-author of the [European Approach](https://www.eqar.eu/kb/joint-programmes/) for Quality Assurance of Joint Programmes and a member of the [EU Micro-Credentials Higher Education Consultation Group](https://education.ec.europa.eu/education-levels/higher-education/micro-credentials).

Initially I became involved in European higher education policy as a member of the Executive Board of the National Union of Students in Germany ([fzs](https://www.fzs.de/)) and later of the European Students’ Union’s ([ESU](https://esu-online.org/), formerly ESIB) Bologna Process Committee, following the topics quality assurance, qualifications frameworks, recognition and social dimension.
